# hivesweeper

hivesweeper is a variation of the original minesweeper game, with the main difference being that it uses hexagons instead of square tiles.

## installation

- the game is made using the Lua-powered [PICO-8 fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). PICO-8 is required to open it. once bought, drag the .p8 file into it.
- if you do not have PICO-8, it is possible to use the [PICO-8 Education Edition](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/) instead and likewise drag the .p8 file into it.

## running
- once loaded, type `run` into the console, or hit `ctrl+r` or `âŒ˜+r` to start the program.
- press `esc` to return to the console, and again to explore the contents of the .p8 file itself.
